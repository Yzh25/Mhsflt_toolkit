#define a project name that will be used to name output files
project:

##define sample and barcode information to create config file
#sample_species only support human and mouse
#sample_type support auto and manual for different sequencing library construction strategy 
#sample_id should be set as a single number (corresponding to the auto sample_type, range 1-12) or multiple numbers separated by commas (corresponding to the manual sample_type, range 1-24)
sample:
  sample_species: human #human or mouse
  sample_type: auto #auto or manual
  sample_id: 1 #1 for auto sample_type or '20,21,22,23,24' for manual sample_type, 


#Sequencing File Inputs:
#For each input file, make one list object & define path and barcode ranges
#base definition vocabulary: BC(n) UMI(n) cDNA(n).
#Barcode range definition needs to account for all ranges. You can give several comma-separated ranges for BC & UMI sequences, eg. BC(1-6,20-26)
#you can specify between 1 and 4 input files
sequence_files:
  file1:
    name: #path to first file
    base_definition:
      - cDNA(11-100) #example: cDNA(11-100)
      - UMI(1-10) #example: UMI(1-10)
  file2:
    name:  #path to second file
    base_definition:
      - cDNA(1-100) #example: cDNA(1-100)
      - BC(101-120) #example: BC(101-120)

#Options for Barcode handling
#You can give either number of top barcodes to use or give an annotation of cell barcodes.
#If you leave both barcode_num and barcode_file empty, zUMIs will perform automatic cell barcode selection for you!
barcodes:
  barcode_num: ~
  automatic: no 
  BarcodeBinning: 1 #Hamming distance binning of close cell barcode sequences.
  nReadsperCell: 1 #Keep only the cell barcodes with atleast n number of reads.
  demultiplex: no #produce per-cell demultiplexed bam files.

#Options related to counting of reads towards expression profiles
counting_opts:
  introns: yes #can be set to no for exon-only counting.
  downsampling: '10000,20000,40000,60000,80000,100000,120000,140000,160000,180000,200000,240000,280000,320000,350000,400000' #Number of reads to downsample to. This value can be a fixed number of reads (e.g. 10000) or a series of numbers separated by commas (e.g. 100000,120000,140000,160000) Barcodes with less than <d> will not be reported. 0 means adaptive downsampling.
  strand: 1 #Is the library stranded? 0 = unstranded, 1 = positively stranded, 2 = negatively stranded
  Ham_Dist: 1 #Hamming distance collapsing of UMI sequences.
  velocyto: no #Would you like velocyto to do counting of intron-exon spanning reads
  primaryHit: yes #Do you want to count the primary Hits of multimapping reads towards gene expression levels?
  twoPass: no #perform basic STAR twoPass mapping

#produce stats files and plots?
make_stats: yes
